		<h1>Dear Helia,</h1>
		<h3>This is not a love letter.</h3>
		<p>But if you're here again, that means you valued this letter to you. I want you to know I'll wait, as long as my heart is there. If you're reading this, then it still is. <br><br>Remember, I'm always only one message away: even just as a friend or stranger you want to talk to. And even if we never get together or lose touch, I hope you find someone that makes you smile. <br><br>The rest of the letter content is the same. This site stays up as a reminder of the effort you are worth.</p>

			<h2>Why did Sylvan make this?</h2>
			<p>And I honestly don't have an answer. But I created this for you.<br> You don't owe me anything. Even though our daily talks have reduced to nothing, <br>but a few interactions here and there. I enjoy everytime we speak. <br>Maybe this site is very over the top. But.. I made it anyways.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>This is not a love letter.</h2>
			<p>You have to know someone to love them, and<br> I don't know you as much as I'd like. But there's something <br>about you.. You make me feel something I haven't felt in a long time.<br> It sounds cringy, yeah. But I think about you. <br>You are the first thing I think about when I wake up, <br>and the last thing when I sleep. Isn't that odd?</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="section right">
			<h2>Think about it.. </h2>
			<p>I only know the superficial stuff.. A few things you told me. <br>A few things on your instagram. Your interests, your college life- <br>but what do I really know? Do I know what makes you cry? <br>What makes you smile? How can I fall so deeply for someone I barely know? <br>I know you have commitment issues. I know you don't know <br>if anything serious can happen between us.</p>

			<h2>And that's okay..</h2>
			<p>There's no rush. There's no need for anything. <br>But if you're reading this, <br>I might as well give you some reasons why you should give us a try in the future! <br>And some stunning friend recommendations.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section dark length">
			<h2>10 Reasons</h2>
			<p>1. I will drive you anywhere. Comic cons, conventions, the movies, or just the store!<br>
			2. I am loyal, sweet, communicative and respectful. I give good hugs. :)<br>
			3. I have a life direction. Almost done with uni, a job- So there's no pressure on you.<br>
			4. I will cook for you and buy you food.<br>
			5. We both like treasure planet, anime and musicals. Mutual interest alert! I read the LOTR so we can talk about it!<br>
			6.  I can fix your laptop and phone when it breaks. I am a tech wizard.<br>
			7. You can read all my comics. Yessir.<br>
			8. I will listen to your day, good or bad. And give you space when needed. :)<br>
			9. I really don't get mad, and am patient, so when we fight, we can resolve peacefully.<br>
			10. I will compliment you, and I'm a very honest person so I mean whatever I say.</p>

			<h2>Friend Recommendations.</h2>
			<p>- Chris - "Sylvan is my best friend since high school and you will NEVER find anyone more realer"<br><br>
				- Djaanwie - 11/10 - "Sylvie heeft inderdaad mijn laptop gefixt"<br><br>
				- Ridaa - 0/10 - "Wilde hangjongere en Apex verslaafd, maar revived me wel meteen,<br> dus dat bewijst loyalty al genoeg. 0 sterren omdat de bitch <br>niet vaak genoeg naar buiten komt en een SIMP is"<br><br>
				- Cindy (my sister LMAO) - 1000/10 - "I know Sylv already all my life and <br> she is the sweetest, most sincere and caring person on earth."<br><br>

		<div class="section dark phalange">
			<h2>Anyways,</h2>
			<p>It's no surprise I like you. And liking you has given me a beautiful sad joy.<br>
				Knowing the fact I can still feel like this for another person.<br>
				It's okay if you don't feel the same. I won't hate you, or cry.<br>
				I don't even want you to commit. So don't feel weird, or forced, or pushed.<br>
				All I want is for you to know that you are amazing, well- <br> The small part I know of you is. And even though I am dying to know you more:<br> I won't convince or beg for it. I'd be okay if this is how this chapter ends.
			</p>

		<div class="section dark">
			<h2>But I have to say</h2>
			<p>I will never forget the feeling I got when we first shared eye contact.<br> At the Julia's when you finally spotted me and smiled at me. <br>Or when we were at the park behind the market, and you sat there: <br>hands in pockets, and you smiled at something I said. <br>Idk what I said anymore even. I might not love you, <br>but I am in love with your smile.<br><br> But.. That's besides the point. If you lost interest, that's okay, I promise. <br>I will move on and stop bothering you. But if there's any chance, <br>or just 0.001% interest left, I only have one request. </p>
