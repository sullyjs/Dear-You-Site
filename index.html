			<h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
			<p> I created this for you.<br> You are my world. I want to say our daily talks put excitement and love in my heart, <br>every interaction I cherish. I enjoy everytime we speak. <br>Maybe this site is very over the top. But.. I made it anyways.</p>

			<h2>My sweet baby.</h2>
			<p>You have to know someone to love them, and<br> I have to say you are the most wonderful person I know. There's something <br>about you.. You make me feel something I haven't felt in a long time.<br> It sounds cringy, yeah. But I think about you. <br>You are the first thing I think about when I wake up, <br>and the last thing when I sleep. Isn't that odd?</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="section right">
			<h2>Think about it.. </h2>
			<p>Ever since I met you.. I fell in love with what you told me. <br>Your interests, your life- <br> I appreciate all you tell me- what makes you cry, <br>what makes you smile. I fell so deeply for youz <br>I know we have our issues, But I love you and I will do so till end of times.</p>
